Using your program, come up with the best estimate you can for the
probability of receiving a straight flush in a random hand.  Put your
answer in a README file.  (The answer is a number between 0 and 1.)

The total number of straight flushes encountered is 15 
The fraction of hands that were	 straight flushes is 0.000015
The estimate I have is 0.000015.
